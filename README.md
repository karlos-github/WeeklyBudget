# WeeklyBudget
Monthly Budget API
An ASP.NET Core Web API for
managing monthly expences. The user can set some typical types of expences (like food, petrol, rent, ...) and
planned amount of money which is going to spent for each expence type per month. Planned amount of money for each expense type
is devided in a 4 weeks budget, so the user can more easily follow his/her expences on week bases. User writes down his/her expences during the month.
The user can follow how much has already spent for each expence type and how much is left to spent for actual month or week of
the month. User can also check expences that were count in each expence types. With the begining of a new month a new budget is created automatically.
